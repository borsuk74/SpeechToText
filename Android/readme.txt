This is a  working project which records audio stream 
as  described on youtube under keys:
"Android Audio Recorder tutorial Kivy/Python".
This application was developed according to instructions on
youtube above. It requires  kivy and pyjnius module. It can't be tested
on desktop as long as pyjnius requires java libraries, present only on 
android. Also it uses some hardcoded directory, which 
could be made model-specific  according to instructions here:
